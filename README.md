# End-To-End Deployment of Zomato Restaurant Ratings Using Flask

The main agenda of this project is:

Perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the Zomato Dataset.

Build an appropriate Machine Learning Model that will help various Zomato Restaurants to predict their respective Ratings based on certain features

Deploy the Machine learning model via Flask that can be used to make live predictions of restaurants ratings
